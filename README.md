# threejs-demo-showcase

This repo is to tests out how to manipulate 3D models that exported from Blender in `three.js`, and try to get similar with how the scene looked like inside Blender's renderer.

**Go check out the [website](https://threejs-demo-showcase.vercel.app/) before it expires.**
> Should turn on the hardware acceleration on chrome for the rotation to be smooth.
